    <h1 id="overview">Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      The <strong>Swami Vivekananda Scholarship</strong>, also known as the <strong>Swami Vivekananda Merit-Cum-Means Scholarship (SVMCM)</strong>, is a flagship program of the Government of West Bengal designed to support deserving students with financial aid. It helps meritorious students from economically weaker sections pursue higher education without financial constraints. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Once students have successfully submitted their applications, the next important step is to check the **Swami Vivekananda Scholarship status**. Monitoring your application status ensures that your form, documents, and verification stages are successfully processed. Whether you’re a fresh applicant or renewing your scholarship, the ability to track your status online provides transparency and peace of mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Students can check their status easily by visiting the <a href="https://swamivivekanandascholarship.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swami vivekananda scholarship official portal</a>. This article provides a complete step-by-step guide on how to check your SVMCM status, understand status updates, troubleshoot issues, and ensure your scholarship amount reaches your bank account successfully.
    </p>

    <h2 id="steps">Step-by-Step Process for Swami Vivekananda Scholarship Status Check</h2>
    <p>
      The process of checking your Swami Vivekananda Scholarship status is completely online and user-friendly. Follow these detailed steps to track your SVMCM application or renewal status:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1: Visit the Official SVMCM Portal</strong><br>
        Open your browser and go to the official SVMCM website. This is the only authentic platform for status updates, application submissions, and renewal processes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2: Click on ‘Track Application’</strong><br>
        On the homepage, find and click on the “Track Application” or “Track Application Status” option. This section is designed for students to monitor their scholarship application in real-time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3: Enter Required Details</strong><br>
        Enter your Application ID and Registered Mobile Number. Ensure that the mobile number matches the one used during registration, as OTP verification may be required for security purposes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4: Verify Captcha and Submit</strong><br>
        Fill in the captcha code accurately to confirm you are not a bot, then click on the “Submit” button.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 5: View Your Application Status</strong><br>
        Once submitted, your current application status will appear on the screen. This may include messages such as “Application Submitted,” “Under Verification,” “Approved by Institution,” “Sanctioned,” or “Payment Disbursed.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 6: Save or Screenshot Your Status</strong><br>
        It’s recommended to take a screenshot or download the status page for future reference, especially if any discrepancies arise later.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always check your SVMCM status from a secure network and avoid third-party websites that claim to show scholarship updates. Use only the official government portal.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Understanding Different SVMCM Status Messages</h2>
    <p>
      When checking your status, you may see different messages at various stages of the scholarship process. Here’s what each status means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Application Submitted:</strong> Your form has been successfully submitted and is awaiting verification by your institution.</li>
      <li><strong>Under Verification:</strong> The institution or district-level authorities are currently verifying your documents and academic details.</li>
      <li><strong>Approved by Institution:</strong> Your college or school has verified your application and forwarded it to higher authorities for approval.</li>
      <li><strong>Sanctioned:</strong> The scholarship has been officially approved by the department and awaits fund transfer.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment Disbursed:</strong> The scholarship amount has been transferred to your registered bank account.</li>
      <li><strong>Rejected:</strong> The application did not meet eligibility or verification requirements. Students can reapply next session with correct documents.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="troubleshoot">Troubleshooting Common Issues During Status Check</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes, students may face technical or verification-related issues while checking their SVMCM status. Here are some common problems and solutions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Invalid Application ID:</strong> Double-check your Application ID; it should match the one mentioned on your acknowledgment slip.</li>
      <li><strong>OTP Not Received:</strong> Ensure your mobile number is active and has network connectivity. Try resending the OTP after a few minutes.</li>
      <li><strong>Page Not Loading:</strong> Clear your browser cache, refresh the page, or use a different browser (Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox recommended).</li>
      <li><strong>Status Not Updated:</strong> Verification can take several weeks depending on your institution. Check again after a few days.</li>
      <li><strong>Discrepancy in Details:</strong> If your marks or name are incorrect, contact your institution immediately for rectification before approval.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Never share your login credentials with anyone. Your applicant ID and password are confidential and can be misused if disclosed.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="renewal">How to Check Renewal Status of Swami Vivekananda Scholarship</h2>
    <p>
      If you have renewed your scholarship for the next academic session, the status checking process remains the same. However, the renewal section may display an additional status message such as “Renewal Submitted” or “Renewal Approved.”
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Log in to your SVMCM account using your existing Application ID and password.</li>
      <li>Click on “Track Application” under the Renewal section.</li>
      <li>Enter your details and submit the form.</li>
      <li>Check whether your renewal has been approved or is under process.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Renewal applicants must ensure that they have passed the previous academic year with the required percentage and that their institution has verified their records. The scholarship renewal helps maintain continuous financial support throughout your studies.
    </p>

    <h2>How Long Does SVMCM Verification Take?</h2>
    <p>
      The verification process usually takes between 2 to 4 weeks after submission. However, during peak months, it may take longer due to a high number of applications. Applicants are advised to check their status periodically and stay patient while the verification progresses.
    </p>
